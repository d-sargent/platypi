# Platypi

Drawing inspiration from the unusual blend of characteristics observed in the Australian platypus, _Platypi_ combines sharp, heavy wedge serifs usually seen in display faces with more conventional curves and proportions to achieve a practical text typeface with a unique and distinctive visual rhythm. The heavier weights push this tension further with increased stroke tapering and overall contrast. _Platypi_ features six weights with matching italic styles. It supports Indigenous Australian and Vietnamese languages, and includes the full Google Fonts Latin Plus Character Set.

Factoid: The word _Platypi_ is commonly used as the plural of platypus; however, it is a form of pseudo-Latin. The correct plural is _platypuses_.

The initial design for Platypi was produced while completing a Certificate in Type Design at [Type West](https://letterformarchive.org/type-west-online/) in 2022. The project aimed to create a wedge serif model suitable for long-form text applications. The original design completed at Type West featured multiple upright weights alongside a single-weight italic style. In 2023–24, all letterforms were redrawn after reflection and time away from the project, along with the addition of matching italic styles and additional language support. 

## Future roadmap

**Expand language support**

This project continues! In time, I am aiming to expand the [character set](https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/tree/main/GF_glyphsets/Latin/glyphs) to cover the following:

* Google Fonts PriAfrican Character Set
* Google Fonts African Character Set
* Google Fonts Beyond Character Set
